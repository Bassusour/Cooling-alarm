# Cooling-alarm
My dorm friends had trouble remembering to fully shut the freezer door after opening it, so I made this alarm to make an automated post if the temperature of a freezer made it below -3 degrees celsius. \
This project uses the IFTTT api to make the post, along with an ESP8266 to make a request. \
This project increased the amount of fully shut freezer doors by 80%.
