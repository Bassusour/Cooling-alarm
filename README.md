# Cooling-alarm
My dorm friends had trouble remembering to fully shut the freezer door after opening it, so I made this alarm to make an automated post if the temperature of a freezer made it below -3 degrees celsius. \
It uses the IFTTT api to make the post.\
This project increased the amount of fully shut freezer doors by 80%.
